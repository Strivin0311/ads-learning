# Sensor Spoofing
*Here're some resources about Sensor Spoofing*

Intros:

* As for sensor spoofing of adversarial attacks, attackers could potentially send deceptive signals to an AV's sensors (such as LIDAR, RADAR, ultrasonic sensors) to trick the system into perceiving non-existent obstacles or ignoring real ones.
