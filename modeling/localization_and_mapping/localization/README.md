# Localization
*Here're some resources about Localization*

Intros:
* This is an introduction about localization/navigation technology, which is highly advanced and mature, largely due to the widespread use of GPS in nearly all contemporary mobile devices.

* However, due to the high demand for precision and the complexity of open environments, satellite-based methods alone no longer suffice to ensure the necessary accuracy and safety.

* As a result, a variety of novel methodologies have emerged, such as GPS/IMU Navigation, Visual Navigation (utilizing LiDAR and Camera), Wireless Communication Assisted Navigation, and Multi-Sensor Fusion Navigation.
