# Occupancy Prediction
*Here're some resources about Occupancy Prediction*


Intros:
* Occupancy Prediction is a sub-task in the prediction module to predict the temperal occupancy map of the surrounding obstacles for the foreseeing future
* It can be seen as the synthetic results of the prediction
