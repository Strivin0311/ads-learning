# Lidar-based 3D Objection Detection
*Here's some resources about Lidar-based 3D Objection Detection*

Intros:
* This directory comprises some methods based on Lidar(may also using camera too) for 3D Object Detection, that aims to recognize and locate objects around the vehicle using data gathered from Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors, which is believed as the core sensor for perception.

* Lidar sensors use lasers to measure distances and can create detailed 3D maps of the surrounding environment, often represented as point clouds. These sensors are particularly effective in providing accurate distance readings, identifying object shapes, and detecting obstacles, even in challenging lighting conditions.

* However, Lidar faces several challenges. Firstly, high-quality Lidar can be costly, potentially raising the price and postponing the grounding of autonomous vehicles. Secondly, weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow can impact its performance and reduce accuracy. Thirdly, Lidar may also struggle with detecting small or distant objects. Last but not least, the extensive data generated by Lidar sensors can be challenging to process and store, requiring powerful hardware and efficient algorithms. Despite these issues, LiDAR remains a critical technology for autonomous driving, with ongoing research focused on improving its capabilities.
