# Trajectory Prediction
*Here're some resources about Trajectory Prediction*

Intros:
* This directory is about the methodology of Trajectory Prediction task in the prediction stage, that is concerned with forecasting the future movements of surrounding dynamic entities such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. This task is fundamental for safe and efficient navigation, as it helps the autonomous vehicle to anticipate potential changes in the environment and make timely, proactive driving decisions.


* In more detail, Trajectory Prediction involves generating plausible future paths for each detected object based on its current and historical states, such as its position, velocity, acceleration, and heading direction. Moreover, it also considers the object's interactions with the environment and other objects to account for the context and behavior patterns.

* For instance, a trajectory prediction module might predict that a pedestrian standing on the sidewalk near a crosswalk might cross the road in the near future, or a vehicle signaling a lane change will move into the adjacent lane. By making these predictions, the autonomous driving system can plan its actions accordingly to avoid potential collisions and ensure a smooth and safe ride.

* Due to the complexity and uncertainty of real-world scenarios, trajectory prediction remains a challenging problem, requiring robust methods that can handle diverse scenarios and take into account the inherently probabilistic nature of human behavior.
