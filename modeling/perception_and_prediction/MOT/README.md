# Multi-Object Tracking
*Here're some resources about Multi-Object Tracking*

Intros: 
* This directory consists of some methods of Multi-Object Tracking(MOT) task within the perception stage, which aims to maintain the identity of each observed object from frame to frame, providing continuous spatial and temporal information about these entities, utilizing sensor data.

* The output of a multi-object tracking system is a set of trajectories, with each trajectory consisting of the spatial position of an object at multiple time points. This information forms the basis for the next stage - the prediction module, where future movements of these tracked objects are estimated.

* By accurately tracking objects in the environment, the autonomous driving system can better understand the scene dynamics, which is crucial for subsequent decision-making and control stages.
