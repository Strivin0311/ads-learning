# Vehicle Dynamics
*Here're some resources about Vehicle Dynamics*

Intros:
* Vehicle Dynamics provides the necessary theoretical framework to understand and predict a vehicle's response to various inputs and conditions, which in turn helps in designing, tuning, and controlling both traditional and autonomous vehicles for enhanced performance and safety.

* Vehicle dynamics models often consider various factors such as vehicle mass, dimensions, center of gravity, wheelbase, track width, tire characteristics, suspension properties, aerodynamics, and more. These models can range from simple, single-track bicycle models for high-level planning tasks to complex, multi-body dynamics models for low-level control and hardware-in-the-loop simulations.
