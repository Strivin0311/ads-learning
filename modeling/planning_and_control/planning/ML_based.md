# Machine Learning-based Planning
*Here're some resources about Machine Learning-based Planning*

Intros:

* Recently, machine learning techniques, especially reinforcement learning and imitation learning, have been increasingly applied to planning problems in autonomous driving. These methods learn from large amounts of data to make decisions, potentially handling complex situations better than traditional methods.
